I am a sociology PhD student at the [Ohio State University](https://sociology.osu.edu/). My research interests surround the mass violence, particularly the prevention, prediction, and legal aftermath, of hate crimes on both a national and global scale. Within the context of the United States, I am interested in hate crimes that target racial and sexual minorities. Globally, my research interests are ongoing violent conflicts such as the persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar, and the war in Ukraine, as well as the collective memories groups form after atrocities such as the 1994 Rwandan Genocide and the Bosnian War. My current projects include an analysis of media reports of hate in the United States from 1970-2021 with [Dana Haynie](https://sociology.osu.edu/people/haynie.7), and a paper looking at women’s community reentry post incarceration for crimes of genocide in Rwanda with [Hollie Nyseth Nzitatira](https://sociology.osu.edu/people/nzitatira.1).

In my free time I enjoy traveling and hiking with my husband, as well as doing yoga, gardening, and playing with our great dane and corgi.
